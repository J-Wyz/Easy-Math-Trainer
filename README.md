# Easy-Math-Trainer
A self hosted website to let you practice simple math operations

This site is just a personal project of mine to help me not mess up basic math in school. The inspiration is from a video I saw about someone called a "Human Calculator" who basically did this for a long time.

To use this site, just download the files and put them all in one folder, then run index.html
